Vaping has changed a whole lot since the primary electronic cigarette was introduced to the environment in the 1960s. Then, the only real purpose of e-cigarettes seemed to be as an alternative for tobacco smoking. Fast forward more than a 10 years and vaping has built the journey from a smoking alternative to a cloud-chasing, flavour phenomenon, and back to a focus on finding a practical alternative to smoking.

## The Origins of Vaping

When the first e-cigarette was officially patented in 1965, its creator, Herbert Gilbert, envisioned it as a 'smokeless non-tobacco cigarette' that would 'simulate' using tobacco. Gilbert never finished up advertising his patent commercially, hence we've left to question how the e-cigarette industry - and the tobacco industry, for that matter - may have evolved if he previously.

It wasn't until 2003 that the community learned of the commercial potential of electronic smoking cigarettes. Like Gilbert's invention, this new device was geared toward smokers who had been looking for another thing. Hon Lik, a 52-year-previous pharmacist in Beijing, is certainly said to have invented these devices after his daddy died of lung cancers.

Also the name of Hon Lik's machine suggested its focus was in smokers. It had been called Ruyan, which means 'like smoke'.


## The Emergence of Vape Mods

Once e-smoking cigarettes made their way to the U.S. in the late 2000s, there had recently been plenty of buzz about their attractiveness with smokers. Our founder, Steve, tried e-cigs around that time and he shifted past a 40-12 months smoking habit to create his unique vapor cigarette and create his own vape company in 2008.

Over the next decade, the facial skin of the vaping industry changed swiftly. Ejuices were obtainable in a much wider variance of flavours and ejuice manufacturers emerged available, giving vapers alternatives beyond prefilled ecig tastes.

The largest shakeup to the vape industry and the image of vaping overall was included with the surging popularity of vape mods. For the larger part of vape record, vapers had been ex - smokers who wanted something that felt like the connection with smoking cigarettes. Mods and high-VG eliquids began to create what some named a subculture of vaping: cloud chasers.

Instead of cig-alike units, vapers started toting large box mods equipped with several programmable settings. Sub-ohm vape coils fell into favor for their ability to create major clouds when used with high-VG juice and vapers commenced building their own coils and personalizing their setups.

Thus, the scene of vaping shifted from a smoker-centric environment to a venue for vape tips, cloud contests, flavour chasing, and coil construction.

## Pod Mods Bring Things Back To Where It Started

Midway into 2018, it appears like vaping has come full circle and returned to its original roots. The JUUL vape program and vape salts reignited a pastime in vaping by smokers, a few of whom said that they had been discouraged by the flood of challenging vape mods that seemed to define vaping for awhile.

JUUL's program and the countless vape pod systems that contain followed it increase contemporary flair to the historic design of electronic cigarettes. Rather than cig-alikes, these hottest devices don't appear to be cigarettes, but they've still lightweight, easy to use, and give a good throat hit.

When paired with the power of nicotine salt eliquid, vape pods will be the go-to choice for progressively more smokers. This isn't to state that package mods and sub-ohm vaping features disappeared.

The world of vaping is merely changing and it's exciting to assume where it will wrap up next!

By the finish of the analysis, 11% of individuals had given up smoking entirely - an amount much like other nicotine-replacement therapies.
